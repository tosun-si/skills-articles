# 🐝 skills-articles

> Skills for writing and publishing Mazlum Tosun's blog articles — the `skills-articles` module of the tosun-si skills catalog.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is the source of truth for its skills — **one module**, composed
with others in a consumer's `pollen.yaml`. Each skill is a standard **Agent
Skill** (`SKILL.md`, the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard),
read natively by **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot** and **Cursor**.

## 🚀 Usage

Install with [pollen](https://github.com/groupbees/pollen): add this module to
your project's `pollen.yaml` (or to `~/.config/pollen/pollen.yaml` for every
project, `pollen update -g`), then run `pollen update`.

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/tosun-si/skills-articles
    revision: vX.Y.Z   # then `pollen autoupdate --freeze` pins its commit
    paths:
      - path: skills
        recurse: true
```

Everything else about pollen — pinning, updates, errors — is in its docs and in
the `pollen` skill it ships (add `groupbees/pollen` with `path: skills`).

## 📋 Skills Catalog

<!-- BEGIN skills-table — auto-generated from skills/*/*/SKILL.md by scripts/skills-catalog.sh --readme; do not edit by hand -->
| Domain | Skill | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Blog | [blog-article-footer](skills/blog/blog-article-footer/) | Mazlum's standard "follow me" footer for blog articles (Medium, dev.to, cross-posts) with his social/media links. Trigger when writing, finishing, or cross-posting a blog article (article.md, article-devto.md, Medium/dev.to drafts), or when asked for the article footer / social links. |
<!-- END skills-table -->

## ✅ CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) calls the shared
`skills-module` workflow of `groupbees/.github`: `skill-validator check
--strict`, `pollen validate`, the generated README table, and
`shellcheck` on every `*.sh`.

## 🏷️ Versioning

Repo-wide git tags (`vX.Y.Z`) cut with `tag-opensource`; the GitHub Releases page
